# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a curated portfolio of data analytics and analytics engineering projects demonstrating skills in:

- SQL (querying, joins, aggregations, optimization)
- Python (data cleaning, analysis, visualization)
- Data modeling (ER diagrams, relational design)
- Databases (relational and NoSQL concepts)
- Data visualization and storytelling

## Projects
Projects are organized by topic and course, with a focus on real-world problem solving, clean code, and clear insights.

More projects will be added as I continue building advanced analytics and data engineering skills.
